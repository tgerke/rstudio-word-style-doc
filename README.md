# word-style-doc

This is a Word template for styling RMarkdown reports in an (approximate) academic article format. Initial setup instructions are from: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html

Note that `word-style-doc.docx` is the active styling document. Incrementral changes are made to `word-style-doc-template.Rmd` through which styles are modified in `word-style-doc-template.docx`. When complete, `word-style-doc-template.docx` needs to manually be copied to overwrite `word-style-doc.docx` to prepare for the next incremental change.
